### Problem 3: Weekend Service Gap

**What We Found:**
- Statistical analysis (T-test, p<0.001) confirms significant difference between weekend and weekday enrollments
- Weekend enrollment volumes are substantially lower
- Working population cannot access services during weekdays

**Societal Impact:**
- Working-class citizens face difficulty in enrollment
- Long queues during weekdays due to compressed demand
- Loss of potential enrollment capacity

**Solution Framework:**
1. **Extended Weekend Hours:** Mandate Saturday operations at all centers
2. **Urban Sunday Centers:** Open Sunday enrollment in high-density urban areas
3. **Corporate/Office Camps:** Organize enrollment camps at offices/factories
4. **Online Appointment System:** Allow weekend slot booking to guarantee service

---

### Problem 4: Infrastructure Underutilization

**What We Found:**
- Over 20% of PIN codes operate less than 25% of possible days
- Expensive infrastructure sits idle while demand exists elsewhere
- Mismatch between center locations and population needs

**Societal Impact:**
- Wasted government resources on underutilized centers
- Citizens travel long distances despite nearby centers being closed
- Inefficient allocation of trained operators

**Solution Framework:**
1. **Utilization Audits:** Monthly review of center utilization rates
2. **Dynamic Scheduling:** Operate centers based on demand prediction models
3. **Center Consolidation:** Merge underutilized nearby centers
4. **Performance-Based Incentives:** Reward high-utilization centers

### Problem 5: Decelerating Enrollment Growth

**What We Found:**
- Momentum analysis (velocity and acceleration metrics) shows slowdown
- Daily enrollment velocity is decreasing over recent periods
- Risk of missing coverage targets

**Societal Impact:**
- Universal Aadhaar coverage delayed
- Newly eligible population (births, immigrants) may remain uncovered
- System loses momentum for updates and corrections

**Solution Framework:**
1. **Enrollment Drives:** National-level campaigns to boost enrollments
2. **Birth Registration Integration:** Auto-trigger Aadhaar enrollment at birth registration
3. **School Enrollment Programs:** Partner with schools for child enrollment
4. **Bottleneck Analysis:** Identify and resolve operational slowdowns
